# Half-Life Featureful SDK [![Build Status](https://github.com/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=featureful)](https://github.com/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful)

Half-Life SDK for GoldSource & Xash3D with some bugfixes and features that can be useful for mod makers.

See the feature overview on the [Wiki](https://github.com/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful/wiki).

# Obtaining source code

Either clone the repository via [git](`https://git-scm.com/downloads`) or just download ZIP via **Code** button on github. The first option is more preferable as it also allows you to search through the repo history, switch between branches and clone the vgui submodule.

To clone the repository with git type in Git Bash (on Windows) or in terminal (on Unix-like operating systems):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FreeSlave/halflife-featureful
```

# Build Instructions

## Windows x86.

### Prerequisites

Install and run [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). The installer allows you to choose specific components. Select `Desktop development with C++`. You can untick everything you don't need in Installation details, but you must keep `MSVC` and corresponding Windows SDK (e.g. Windows 10 SDK or Windows 11 SDK) ticked. You may also keep `C++ CMake tools for Windows` ticked as you'll need **cmake**. Alternatively you can install **cmake** from the [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) and during installation tick *Add to the PATH...*.

### Opening command prompt

If **cmake** was installed with Visual Studio Installer, you'll need to run `Developer command prompt for VS` via Windows `Start` menu. If **cmake** was installed with cmake installer, you can run the regular Windows `cmd`.

Inside the prompt navigate to the hlsdk directory, using `cd` command, e.g.
```
cd C:\Users\username\projects\halflife-featureful
```

Note: if halflife-featureful is unpacked on another disk, nagivate there first:
```
D:
cd projects\halflife-featureful
```

### Building

Сonfigure the project:
```
cmake -A Win32 -B build
```
Note that you must repeat the configuration step if you modify `CMakeLists.txt` files or want to reconfigure the project with different parameters.

The next step is to compile the libraries:
```
cmake --build build --config Release
```
`hl.dll` and `client.dll` will appear in the `build/dlls/Release` and `build/cl_dll/Release` directories.

If you have a mod and want to automatically install libraries to the mod directory, set **GAMEDIR** variable to the directory name and **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX** to your Half-Life or Xash3D installation path:
```
cmake -A Win32 -B build -DGAMEDIR=mod -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life"
```
Then call `cmake` with `--target install` parameter:
```
cmake --build build --config Release --target install
```

#### Choosing Visual Studio version

You can explicitly choose a Visual Studio version on the configuration step by specifying cmake generator:
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 -B build
```

### Editing code in Visual Studio

After the configuration step, `HALFLIFE-FEATUREFUL.sln` should appear in the `build` directory. You can open this solution in Visual Studio and continue developing there.

## Linux x86. Portable steam-compatible build using Steam Runtime in chroot

### Prerequisites

The official way to build Steam compatible games for Linux is through steam-runtime.

Install schroot. On Ubuntu or Debian:

```
sudo apt install schroot
```

Clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime and follow instructions: [download](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/blob/e014a74f60b45a861d38a867b1c81efe8484f77a/README.md#downloading-a-steam-runtime) and [setup](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/blob/e014a74f60b45a861d38a867b1c81efe8484f77a/README.md#using-schroot) the chroot.

```
sudo ./setup_chroot.sh --i386 --tarball ./com.valvesoftware.SteamRuntime.Sdk-i386-scout-sysroot.tar.gz
```

### Building

Now you can use cmake and make prepending the commands with `schroot --chroot steamrt_scout_i386 --`:
```
schroot --chroot steamrt_scout_i386 -- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build-in-steamrt -S .
schroot --chroot steamrt_scout_i386 -- cmake --build build-in-steamrt
```

## Linux x86. Portable steam-compatible build without Steam Runtime

### Prerequisites

Install C++ compilers, cmake and x86 development libraries for C, C++ and SDL2. On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install cmake build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev:i386
```

### Building

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

Note that the libraries built this way might be not compatible with Steam Half-Life. If you have such issue you can configure it to build statically with c++ and gcc libraries:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc" -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

Alternatively, you can avoid libstdc++/libgcc_s linking using small libsupc++ library and optimization build flags instead(Really just set Release build type and set C compiler as C++ compiler):
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=cc -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```
To ensure portability it's still better to build using Steam Runtime or another chroot of some older distro.

## Linux x86. Portable steam-compatible build in your own chroot

### Prerequisites

Use the most suitable way for you to create an old distro 32-bit chroot. E.g. on Ubuntu/Debian you can use debootstrap.

```
sudo apt install debootstrap schroot
sudo mkdir -p /var/choots
sudo debootstrap --arch=i386 jessie /var/chroots/jessie-i386 # On Ubuntu type trusty instead of jessie
sudo chroot /var/chroots/jessie-i386
```

```
# inside chroot
apt install cmake build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev
exit
```

Create and adapt the following config in /etc/schroot/chroot.d/jessie.conf (you can choose a different name):

```
[jessie]
type=directory
description=Debian jessie i386
directory=/var/chroots/jessie-i386/
users=yourusername
groups=adm
root-groups=root
preserve-environment=true
personality=linux32
```

Insert your actual user name in place of `yourusername`.

### Building

Prepend any make or cmake call with `schroot -c jessie --`:
```
schroot --chroot jessie -- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build-in-chroot -S .
schroot --chroot jessie -- cmake --build build-in-chroot
```

## Android
1. Set up [Android Studio/Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Android Studio
Open the project located in the `android` folder and build.

### Command-line
```
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Customizing the build
settings.gradle:
* **rootProject.name** - project name displayed in Android Studio (optional).

app/build.gradle:
* **android->namespace** and **android->defaultConfig->applicationId** - set both to desired package name.
* **getBuildNum** function - set **releaseDate** variable as desired.

app/java/su/xash/hlsdk/MainActivity.java:
* **.putExtra("gamedir", ...)** - set desired gamedir.

src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:
* **application->android:label** - set desired application name.
* **su.xash.engine.gamedir** value - set to same as above.

## Nintendo Switch

### Prerequisites

1. Set up [`dkp-pacman`](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman).
2. Install dependency packages:
```
sudo dkp-pacman -S switch-dev dkp-toolchain-vars switch-mesa switch-libdrm_nouveau switch-sdl2
```
3. Make sure the `DEVKITPRO` environment variable is set to the devkitPro SDK root:
```
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
```
4. Install libsolder:
```
source $DEVKITPRO/switchvars.sh
git clone https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/libsolder.git

## PlayStation Vita

### Prerequisites

1. Set up [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/).
2. Install [vita-rtld](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/vita-rtld):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/vita-rtld.git && cd vita-rtld
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j2 install
   ```

### Building with waf:
```
./waf configure -T release --psvita
./waf build
```

### Building with CMake:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$VITASDK/share/vita.toolchain.cmake" -DCMAKE_PROJECT_HLSDK-PORTABLE_INCLUDE="$VITASDK/share/vrtld_shim.cmake" ..
make -j
```

## Other platforms

Building on other architectures (e.g x86_64 or arm) and POSIX-compliant OSes (e.g. FreeBSD) is supported.

### Prerequisites

Install C and C++ compilers (like gcc or clang), cmake and make.

### Building

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

Force 64-bit build:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D64BIT=1 -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

### Building with waf

To use waf, you need to install python (2.7 minimum)

```
./waf configure -T release
./waf
```

Force 64-bit build:
```
./waf configure -T release -8
./waf
```

## Build options

Some useful build options that can be set during the cmake step.

* **GOLDSOURCE_SUPPORT** - allows to turn off/on the support for GoldSource input. Set to **ON** by default on x86 Windows and x86 Linux, **OFF** on other platforms.
* **64BIT** - allows to turn off/on 64-bit build. Set to **OFF** by default on x86_64 Windows, x86_64 Linux and 32-bit platforms, **ON** on other 64-bit platforms.
* **USE_VGUI** - whether to use VGUI library. **OFF** by default. You need to init `vgui_support` submodule in order to build with VGUI.

This list is incomplete. Look at `CMakeLists.txt` to see all available options.

Prepend option names with `-D` when passing to cmake. Boolean options can take values **OFF** and **ON**. Example:

```
cmake .. -DUSE_VGUI=ON -DGOLDSOURCE_SUPPORT=ON -DCROWBAR_IDLE_ANIM=ON -DCROWBAR_FIX_RAPID_CROWBAR=ON
```
